# Rambler - UnRESTful Rails controllers

Rambler provides a Sinatra-like DSL that makes easy to write and manage non-RESTful controllers.
 
## Installation

``` rb
gem "rumbler"
```

## Usage

Create a non-RESTful controller

``` rb
# app/controllers/site/site_controller.rb
class Site::SiteController < ApplicationController
  action :home, "/" do
    @title = "Hi!"
  end
  
  action :blog, "/blog" do
    @posts = Post.order("created_at DESC").page(params[:page])
  end 

  action :post, "/blog/:id" do
    @post = Post.find(params[:id])
    unless @post.published || (current_user && current_user.administrator?)
      raise ResourceNotFoundError.new
    end
  end
  
  action :contacts, "/contacts" do
  end

  action :submit_contact, "/contacts", :via => "post" do
    @contact = Contact.new(params[:contact])
    @contact.save
    redirect_to contact_thanks_path 
  end
  
  action :contact_thanks, "/contacts/thanks" do
  end

end

```

Automap your routes!

``` rb
  # config/routes.rb

  # ...
  mount_controller "site/site"
  # ...
```
